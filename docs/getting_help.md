### Browser Requirements

Easy Trips is 100% web based and runs best in Internet Explorer 9+ or the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox.  If you are using a non-supported browser, especially Internet Explorer 8 or below, please upgrade or switch browsers. 

### I don't know how to do something

For assistance or questions, your best source is either this guide or to contact your transportation department. 

### I found a bug

The best thing to do is click the little "Feedback" icon and describe your problem.  It's helpful if you include what you were trying to do and what you would have expected to see happen instead.  Of course, sometimes, bugs don't hide.

### I had a great idea

We love great ideas!  Again, the easiest thing to do is to share it via the "Feedback" icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
