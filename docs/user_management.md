### Managing Users

The User Management pages provides the option to edit current user information or invite new user.

    Tip!  The easiest way to on-board people is to Invite them!


###  Invite More Users

After clicking "Invite More Users" on the User Management page, you will be directed to the "Invite Users" screen in order to provide specific information for who you are inviting to Easy Trips. This section allows you to:

* Send multiple email invitations, using a comma to separate each address.
* Select a starting role to be applied to all invited users.  This can be changed later.
* Include a customized indroductory email to welcome them. 

Once all of the necessary information is filled out, click the "Send Invitation(s)" button at the bottom. 


#### What happens next?

Each invited user will receive two emails
    * one which you just configured welcoming them
    * another with the URL, their username, and a starting password to access Easy Trips

As soon as they sign in their email will be confirmed.  It is recommended that users reset their passwords since email is an unsecured medium.


###  Updating User Info

The top portion of the User Update page allows for editing the user's name, email, job title, phone number, and roles. The roles relate to user permissions while the job title only pertains to the user's position within their respective organization and has no bearing on Easy Trips permissions. After filling in the appropriate information, click "Update User" to save changes.

The bottom portion of the User Update page enables the adding or removal of specific schools that the user manages. 



## All about Permissions

Permissions are granted, or denied, on a role-based basis for easy management.  Easy Trips currently has the below user roles to meet your needs:

* District Admin - They can do just about everything.
* Transportation Staff - They can do almost everything a District Admin can, but cannot configure district-wide settings, such as whether "Budgeting" is enabled.
* School Admin - School Admins can Create and send Change Request.
* School User - School Users can do almost everything a School Admin can, except manage Instructors.
* Accounting User - These users can generate billing exports.


    Note:  Anybody can be assigned to a school and set up as a School Authorizer.
